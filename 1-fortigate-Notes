The company is fortnet and has a product call Fortigate firewall.

Download and import the fortigate image to the vmware from https://support.fortinet.com
To login: username: admin without password.

#################################
To set an ip and allow https to an interface:#
fortigate# show system interface
fortigate# config system interface
fortigate# edit port1 - ports are 0-8, you can edit anyone
fortigate# set ip 10.10.10.16a 255.255.255.0 
fortigate# set allowaccess http https - you can add any protocol you want like ssh, telnet, etc....
fortigate# end

Now you can access the fortigate admin interface, credentials are admin without a password.

#################################
To add/edit/remove/etc.. users:
System -> Administrator - create users
System -> Admin Profiles - create user profiles, each profile has its own permissions
- prof_admin profile has only read permissions only 
- super_admin profile has everything 
- you can create a costume profiles, as you like with specific permissions

To manage users with cli:
fortigate# config system admin
fortigate# edit $username
fortigate# set trusthost1 10.10.10.20/24 - to add specific hosts that allow to access this username!
fortigate# end

#################################
To change the firewall name, edit the time, ports, 
System -> Setting

#################################

#################################
Policies: is a rulea, it matches patterns of the traffic like dst and src ip or port, device type, etc...
Policy & Objects -> IPv4aaa Policy (create new)
- Name (policy name)
- incoming Interface  
- outgoing Interface 
- Source
- Destination 
- Schedule (to set the time, where this policy avialable)
- Action ACCEPT/DENAY/LEARN (Learn using AI to learn traffics and allow/deny depends on the learned data)
- NAT
- Security Profiles
- Logging

#################################
Operating Modes: 2 Operating Modes
1. NAT Mode: Fortigate acts here as an OSI layer 3 device (like router, each interface has its own ip and broadcast domain)
2. Transparent Mode: Fortigate acts here as an OSI layer 2 device (like switch, each interface does not has ip and traffic/frames are forwarded based on athe MAC)
When do we use, what ??? (no clear answer yet!)

To change the fortigate from NAT mode to Transparent mode with the cli:
fortigate# config system settings
fortigate# opmode transparent

fortigate# get router info routing-table all - to show the routing/ip table
fortigate# diagnose netlink brctl name host root.b - to show the mac table

in Transparent Mode every interface is on the same broadcast domain even if we interfaces associated with its own VLAN domains,
so each packet will arrive fortigate will forward it to any internal interface until it finds and dst MAC. This could be an issue especially on large networks, 
so we either create different domains for different interfaces or to split the broadcast domain into several broadcast domain, that called "a forward domain".
so we will create 3 internal vlans to 3 internal interfaces, then we create the same forward domain for these 3 interfaces, so any packets arrives on one of those interfaces will only be broadcasted to the other 2 interfaces.
Network -> Interface (create new -> Interface) and give the interface a
- name 
- alias
- Type: Vlan
- Interface: to the specific interface you want
- vlan id 
Note: Each vlan has a different name and vlan id.

Now we group these interfaces to one domain with cli:
fortigate# config system interface
fortigate# edit $interface_name1
fortigate# set forward-domain 11
fortigate# next
fortigate# edit $interface_name2
fortigate# set forward-domain 11
fortigate# nex
fortigate# edit $interface_name3
fortigate# set forward-domain 11
fortigate# next
fortigate# end
Now any traffic will comes to any on these interfaces will only be braodcasted to the other 2 interfaces.

#################################
To setup an interface:
- Alias
- type: Physical interface
- Role: LAN
- Manual IP 
- adminstrative access
- DHCP Service (if needed)
- Enable Device Detection (allow fortigate to detect which device is connected to it. Used for filtering/blocking/allowing specific systems)
- Enable Active Scanninga

Next we do after creating the interface, to grab a switch and connect every host on that interface to that switch and connect that the switch to our interface. 
Then connect the interface to our ISP modem (interface that goes to WAN) and lastly configure a static route.

#################################
Zones: is a way to group different interfaces (that does not have any references such as firewall policies) and group them together into a logical zone, to use that zone in our policy configuration.

Create an interface
Network -> Interfaces (create new -> interface)
- alias
- Role: LAN
- IP
- Administrative Access: Ping + SNMP
- DHCP
- Enable Device Detection
- Enable Active Scanning

Create a new Zone:
Network -> Interfaces (Create new -> Zone)
- Name
- Interfaces Members (set the interfaces you created/want)

So we use now this zone in our policy configuration to configure one unified policy that all members of that interfaces in the zone will have to obey.

#################################
To enable DHCP Server:
Network -> Interfaces (create new -> interface)
Steps already know and the terms are clear so just follow your kownledge and setup the DHCP server
Note: Mac Reservation + Access Control section is for specifying a MAC to any ip or block a mac address.

With cli:
fortigate# config system dhcp server
fortigate# show dhcp server (?)
fortigate# edit $dhcp_server_number
fortigate# show full
fortigate# set dns-server 1.1.1.1 - change dns server ip
fortigate# next
fortigate# end

Open the additional dhcp options tab: (play around with it)

#################################
To enable VLAN's:
Used in a network with one broadcast domain, so we create VLAN's to isolate some devices from each other and put specific ones in a sperated broadcast domain.
In large network, on broadcast domain may be an issue, so you have to use Virtual LAN (VLAN) to split the network to many broadcast domains.
This makes the network much more secure and efficient, because a few and not all devices recieve unnecessary packets. 
VLAN can be configured on a NAT mode or Transparent mode fortigate.
Onces we configure the VLAN on a port, the port becomes a trunk port (means a port capable of delivering packets from different domains and not only the domains that was configured initially on the physical interface)

Choose a physical interface/port and divide it to 2 broadcast domains
select an interface then (create new -> VLAN) and create a VLAN. The VLAN will be added automatically under the selected interface.
Then create 2 policies (Policy & Objects -> IPv4 Policy - (create new -> policy)).
The 1. policy: Incoming Interface set to the first VLAN/network, Outgoing set to WAN and Service set to only FTP 
The 2. policy: Incoming Interface set to the second VLAN/network, Outgoing set to WAN and Service set to all

Summary: The above show us that we can have one interface and this interface has many broadcast domains and each broadcast domain can have its own policy.

#################################
To create a hardware virtual switch:
There is a soft switch (switch on the application level) and hardware switch (switch on the hardware level)

Configure hardware virtual switch with cli:
fortigate# config system virtual switch
fortigate# get - to show the configured virtual switches
fortigate# edit $vswitch_name - edith switch, if not exist create it
fortigate# set physical-switch sw0 - set th v-switch to the physical port/interface
fortigate# config port
fortigate# edit $port/interface_name1
fortigate# next
fortigate# edit $port/interface_name2
fortigate# next
fortigate# edit $port/interface_name3
fortigate# next
fortigate# end
fortigate# config system virtual switch
fortigate# get
fortigate# end

and from the GUI interface under network -> interfaces -> select the v-switch and edit it as you like

#################################
NAT:
Source NAT: For outgoing traffic
Destination NAT: For incoming traffic
Dynamic NAT: Maps the private ip's to the first avialable public ip's 
Overloading NATa == Static NAT: Maps the private ip's to only single public ip, that can be done with port assigned.

to configure Dynamic NAT:
Policy & Objects -> IPv4 Policy -> select any interface and edit it -> enable NAT -> Dynamic ip pool
- Name
- Type
- IP Range

to configure Static NAT:
Policy & Objects -> Addresses (create new -> address) 
Policy & Objects -> Virtual IP's (create new)

#################################
Routing:
If the fortigate is deployed in NAT mode, it acts as OSI layer 3 router device.
fortigate# get router info routing-table all
fortigate# get router info routing-table database

Network -> Static Routes (create new)
- Detination
- Gateway
- Interface
- Administrative Distance

configure with cli:
fortigate# config static static
fortigate# show full

Monitor -> Routing Monitor
